RFI Code Challenge
==================

Radio interferometry has as one of its major challenges the issue of Radio Frequency Interface.

This takes multiple forms from CW tones to spread-spectrum communications. It can be self-generated, terrestrial or space based.

Task
----

The task is to write code to demonstrate a possible mitigation technique for radio interference.

In particular, we would like you to generate radio telescope appropriate data (basically noise like), insert an artificial source of interference, and the demonstrate recovery of the insertion by indicating a set of flags on the original dataset.

This is not intended to be a detailed simulation of radio astronomy data, a simple model is perfectly adequate. You may assume a single telescope producing channelised noise like data.

Demonstration
-------------

Please clone this repository and submit a link to the clone as your submission. Ideally the resultant code should be standalone (the use of standard libraries is encouraged) and allow a parameterised run which inserts RFI and produces a list of detected RFI at conclusion.

The preferred language is Python, but you may use any language you feel best showcases your abilities.

Demonstration of code quality and testing will be important.

Queries
-------

Limited queries will be entertained - but make sure to ask relevant questions.
